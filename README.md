History

I wrote the <a href='http://www.marc-nostromo.com/the-arduino-piano-squealer-synth/'>original code</a> of this synth under the codename 'Squealer' for Critter & Guitarri's pocket piano, now discontinued.
It's been then forked by Collin Cunningham to support his <a href='http://narbotic.com/projects/midivox/'>midivox shield</a> under the codename of 'Healer'
The it's been taken by <a href='http://www.larsby.com/johan/'>Johan Larsby</a> who made another version called 'Dealer' and is used a initial commit here
